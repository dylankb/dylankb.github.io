<p class="message">
  In a former life I was based out of Beijing, China where I worked in education, tech, and business intelligence. I'm now a software developer in Portland, OR, where I focus on projects using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. I've joined the developer community because I love to learn, teach, and build. If you think I can be helpful to you in any way, please feel free to reach out.
