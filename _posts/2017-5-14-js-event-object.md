[^1] _A post about asking questions to get Crystal Clearâ„¢, incidentally about event objects_

In the early days of the web, users navigated through web pages and applications rather slowly for a number of reasons, but in part it was because they were doing it one page refresh at a time. Basically, any navigation or application state change on a page needed to be sent as a request to the server, and these changes could only become visible to the user after the response delivered new HTML to browser and it reloaded (refreshed) completely to rebuild the page. JavaScript allowed web developers to fundamentally change this paradigm, making it one of the most important programming languages for modern day web applications.

JavaScript changed modern development by allowing page changes to occur without making the page go through a full request/response cycle and page reload. This made it possible users to access faster, more interactive web experiences. Part of the reason that JavaScript was able to make this impact is because "knows how to wait". What I mean by that is JavaScript application code on the browser usually needs to wait for something to transpire first before running, for example a user's click. A key piece of the puzzle to allow that to execute conditionally based on events is the __event object__. An event object represents <u>data related to how, what, and when an event in the browser occurred</u>. When I ran into the concept of events, I wanted to be sure I was pretty clear on the principles that underly JavaScript's ability to create, register, listen, and execute event-based code.

Below are some questions, and hopefully answers, that mirror some of the confusions I had when learning about JavaScript events. But first, let's go over some facts about browser events.

### Events - If only we listen, they will be heard

The browser and DOM are firing events all the time regardless of what code we've written.

Besides obvious ones like a user clicking on the page, we also have things like the `DOMContentLoaded` event, which occurs when the DOM is parsed from HTML, and `Window.onload`, fires once all of the page's assets are finished loading. However, apart from the fact that certain browser based events telling us things how well or quickly our application runs, they can't influence how code our application runs until we listen for them.

Event-based code is the process of tying the execution of these events to code in our applications.

### The Click Event: There and Back Again

So, let's briefly overview what event implementation, capturing, bubbling are to make sure we're on the same page.

#### Setting up an event listener

Elements, windows, documents and more all implement the [EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) interface which allows developers to add [EventListeners](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-EventListener), often via the `addEventListener` method, which specifies an event type and a callback.

```js
document.addEventListener('click',
  function(e) { console.log('Clicked!', e) };
);
```

But you can also use [global event handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers) either in your JS or HTML if you apply it as an element attribute.

```js
<button onclick="console.log('Clicked!', event)">
  Click me
</button>
```

If the user clicks on the button element in the browser, then their console would receive an the contents of an event object back.

```js
MouseEvent { currentTarget: null, target: div, type: 'click' }
```

The actual object contains more properties than I've listed above, but we won't be covering those in this article. Also, don't worry about the `currentTarget` here or why it's `null`, we'll go over why that is a little later.

If you're curious about all the properties that are on the event object, you can open this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/ZyyEeP?editors=1010) and your browser's developer tools to see the logged object in the Console tab.

#### Event DOM traversal & Propagation

I should also point out that an event traverses (moves across) the DOM when it dispatches, and there are certain rules which dictate this behavior.

![An event traversing through the DOM tree](assets/event-bubbling.png)

_There are many overviews of DOM event traversal, but this one is mine_

When an element dispatches an event, all parent elements have the event fire in a _capturing_ phase, the target fires in the _target phase_, and parent elements again fire in the _bubbling phase_. The listener by default only executes the event handler code in the _target_ and _bubbling_ stages.

This may seem a bit theoretical at this point, but I'll be referencing this later on.

Now, on to the questions:

### 1) How exactly does the `target` property get set?

Here is the definition of the `target` property from the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target).

> A reference to the object that dispatched the event

Ok, seems straightforward. You click on something and that's the element which dispatches the event. This made me think of a slightly more complicated follow up question - if I add an event listener to a parent element and click on the inner child element, will the child element or the parent element dispatch the event?

A visual representation usually helps me, so I made the simplest one I could. In this example, there's a `div.button-container` element, outlined in red, that contains a `button.button` element.

```html
<div class="button-container">
  <button class="button">Button</button>
</div>
```

 I then attached an event listener to the `div.button-container` element once the DOM was loaded to fire a `logger` callback function.

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  document.querySelector('.button-container').addEventListener('click', logger);
});
```

In this case event listener is listening for the built-in `click` event and the `logger` function logs information on the event object - specifically what the `target` property is for each click event. Try clicking on both the `button` and `div` to see what happens.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="PmazLp" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="dylankb" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Bound container - target" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/PmazLp/">Bound container - target</a> by Dylan (<a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb">@dylankb</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

You'll notice that the `target` element changes depending on which of the two elements you click, regardless of whether it is nested or not.

If that seems like too simple of an explanation for you, I've got another one ;). In all seriousness, this may be a slightly less straightforward approach to thinking about how a `target` is set, but it actually was helpful in cementing my understanding.

#### Branch depth: An alternative way about to think about target elements

There is [a description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click) for the `click` event's `target` property in the MDN documentation that doesn't seem entirely accurate, but it did help me think about how the target property is actually determined.

> The event target (the topmost target in the DOM tree).

To put this that into context, let's look at some pictures first.

First, here's the our containing `div`, highlighted by Chrome devtools:

![](/assets/container-dimensions.png)

Looking here, it clearly contains the `button` element nested inside it. Because it contains the `button` element, to click the `button` you have to effectively click on the `div` as well.

Here's a DOM tree of our the markup in the previous code example: ![DOM tree node visual using button and container from post](/assets/dom-tree.png)
[^2]

Most representations of the DOM are "upside-down", in that nested elements are the branches that extend downwards. So in this case, the `button` element is "lower" than the `div`. We can think about the `div` node pictured above as a starting a distinct "branch" of the DOM tree. It's distinct in that containing elements lower down in the branch have a parent node (or element) with an attached event listener.

So, let's review what we know.

- The event listener is attached to the parent `div` element
- The `div` contains the `button`
- Another way of saying that the `button` element is nested in the `div` is to say that that the `div` is higher in the DOM tree

Now pretend we have an element with an event listener attached to it. If the element with the event listener or any other element lower than it on the branch is clicked, these elements can set a `target` property on a new event object. So in this case, either the `div` or the `button` could set the `target` property.

If we click on button that's inside of `div`, how do we know which on will set the `target`? If you click on an element, the most specific to that click will be the one to set `target`. Another way of phrasing specific is to say, the "lowest" possible element down the given DOM tree branch. If you click directly on the `button`, sure you clicked the `div` as well, but the most specific one is the `button`. We can also see the `button` is lower on that branch.

In summary, for a given click, whichever element was the "lowest" or "bottom-most" element in that DOM tree branch will set the `target` property. Not sure if that helps, but I thought that was an interesting way to think about something as simple as clicking something on a page :)

#### Dispatching events: Another target setting description

Another way of describing how the `target` property is determined is on this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/Comparison_of_Event_Targets) comparing different event targets.

>The DOM element on the left-hand side of the call that triggered this event, eg:
`element.dispatchEvent(event)``

There may be some further [implementation details](https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#dispatching-events) that could help us determine which element calls the `dispatchEvent`, but that may be a bit too low level for the purposes of application development.

TLDR; In the example of the `click` event, the element you click on _should_ reliably be the `target` property.

### 2) How does a child element dispatch an event to a parent listener?

We came to a nice simple conclusion above that the target property is basically whatever element you directly clicked on. But, how actually does the event object fire if you're not directly clicking on the parent element?

Remember when I said that funny looking chart with arrows would be important, well that time has come.

Here, I'll even show it again for good reference.

![An event traversing through the DOM tree](assets/event-bubbling.png)

So recall that all events:

* Travel up and down their DOM tree branch twice.
* The listener by default only executes the event handler code in the _target_ and _bubbling_ stages.

Now that we understand how traversal works and how the `target` property is set, we have the tools to understand how an event on a child element triggers a parent listener. If it isn't clear yet, **bubbling** is a key player here.

Dispatched events will bubble up from child elements, and by default will trigger parent listeners. Therefore, a click on `button` will fire the event handler attached to `div.button-container`.

### 3) How do the `target` and `currentTarget` properties vary under different settings?

First, let's look into how the `currentTarget` is determined. Here's the definition from the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget):

> ... It always refers to the element to which the event handler has been attached, as opposed to `event.target` which identifies the element on which the event occurred.

Recall that our event listener is attached to the `div`. Given this fact and the above definition, we can probably guess what the current target will be, but a coded visual always helps:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MmXMPG" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="dylankb" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Bound container - targets" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/MmXMPG/">Bound container - targets</a> by Dylan (<a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb">@dylankb</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Whether we click on the `button` or the `div`, the `currentTarget` is always the `div`. That makes sense, as the `div` is "the element to which the event handler" has been attached.

Going back to the definition of `currentTarget`, here's a preceding sentence that I left out earlier:

> Identifies the current target for the event, as the event traverses the DOM.

We can actually confirm that `currentTarget` is transient in nature because of this previous log snippet we included in a of a simple click event attached to `document`

```js
MouseEvent { currentTarget: null, target: div, type: 'click' }
```

Here we'd actually expect `currentTarget` to be `document`, right? Well, it is but logging an element [returns a reference to an object](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26496176/when-loggin-an-event-object-currenttarget-is-null-but-when-logging-event-curre), not the necessarily the values at the time of logging.

If we change the logging by copying the object values, we'll actually get the value. If you want to see an example, open this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/RZKoBE/) and your developer tools to see the log.

Now that we know `currentTarget` changes during DOM travel, there's more questions to ask...

### 4) What are the implications of event DOM traversal?

Ok, so with that in mind, let's create a second additional separate event handler function called `innerLogger`. We will attach this listener to the nested `button` element.

```js
document.querySelector('.button').addEventListener('click', innerLogger);
```

The functionality is entirely the same - all that's different is it prepends "INNER" to all our previous output. Try clicking the two page elements in the results tab.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="EmRBrr" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="dylankb" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Bound container - bubbling" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/EmRBrr/">Bound container - bubbling</a> by Dylan (<a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb">@dylankb</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Hmm, when clicking on button our output appears to be the same as before - it's as if nothing seems to have changed.

What's happened is we've created a subtle bug. If you were to insert a debugging statement or a `console.log` within `innerLogger`, you would see that the `innerLogger` event handler does indeed fire. The problem is that our `logger` event handler ALSO fires. In the first question we already confirmed that parent elements with event listeners will fire when the specified event occurs on their child elements. In this case, a button click bubbles up through each successive parent element until reaching the `window` element. The effect is that the output of `innerLogger` is replaced, or overwritten, by the output of `logger`.

In this case, stopping the continued propagation of the `click` event is the solution. We can stop the event from continuing to traverse (or propagate) across the DOM by commenting out line 2 in the Codepen. Once that's done, we can now have separate logging behavior for the `button` and `div` click events.

In summary, one implication of DOM traversal is parent elements that share the same click event may fire. The reason that parent elements may fire after is due to bubbling. If we were using capturing, the result would be the parent elements or "top" elements would fire first.

### 5) Is `this` equal to `currentTarget` or `target` inside event handler callback functions?

The answer is by default - sometimes both, but almost always `this` is the same as `currentTarget`.

Let's talk about why this is. This [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Event_handlers#Event_handler's_parameters_this_binding_and_the_return_value) contains the first explanation on how the `this` binding is set.

> When the event handler is invoked, the `this` keyword inside the handler is set to the DOM element on which the handler is registered.

The explanation is fairly understandable; `this` will be set to the element with the attached event listener. When using default bubbling, sometimes the element with the attached listener also dispatches the event to become the `target` (i.e clicking on the container `div`), and sometimes a nested element dispatches the event (i.e the `button`). That's why the answer is "sometimes both".

Let's log out the `this` context to confirm our understanding.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="ZKjYbm" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="dylankb" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Bound container - this" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/ZKjYbm/">Bound container - this</a> by Dylan (<a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb">@dylankb</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Confirmed. In this case, the event listener was attached to the `div`. Therefore within the callback, `div` is both the `currentTarget` and the `this` context.

With all that said, the provided explanation may be slightly superficial, but we'll revisit why in just a bit.

### 6) Does event delegation affect event object properties and context differently?

Event delegation lets you avoid adding individual event listeners to each element, and instead control which child events fire through attaching an event listener to a parent and adding additional code.

We could change our code to take advantage of event delegation through making changes like:

* Attaching our event listener to the `document`, and avoid the `DOMContentLoaded` event to fire
* Add additional nested elements inside the `button-container` and have them not fire event listeners, behave differently, or whatever we want.

We're not going to make those changes right now. Instead, we'll do a somewhat contrived, but very simple, implementation of event delegation. We'll wrap our `logger` code in a small conditional.

```js
function logger() {
  if (e.target.tagName === "BUTTON") {
    // Leave existing logger code
}
```

The main body of our `logger` code will now only fire when the `button` is clicked, and not when the outer `button-container` is clicked.

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="zwLGqB" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="dylankb" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Bound container - delegation" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/zwLGqB/">Bound container - delegation</a> by Dylan (<a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb">@dylankb</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

As you can see, the other event properties are exactly the same as before event delegation. The `currentTarget` is still the `div`, the `target` remains `button` when clicking on the button, etc.

The story is a bit different with jQuery, however.

#### Understanding jQuery delegation principles

First, I want to go back to an issue I said I had about an excerpt from the `this` binding documentation. The excerpt says `this` is "... set to the DOM element on which the handler is registered", which works fine for plain JavaScript. However, I prefer this definition from a different part of the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#As_a_DOM_event_handler) covering `this`.

>When a function is used as an event handler, its this is set to the element the event fired from

The reason why is that in jQuery the `on` method allows for an optional `selector` parameter.

`$('.button-container').on('click', '.button', logger);`

Using jQuery parlance, up to now we've been directly binding elements (event targets) to their event listeners. Delegated events in jQuery have slightly different rules, as explained [here](http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events)

> The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector.

To see the implications, click on the button below:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="eWjyXq" data-default-tab="result" data-user="dylankb" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Delegated container - jQuery" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb/pen/eWjyXq/">Delegated container - jQuery</a> by Dylan (<a href="http://codepen.io/dylankb">@dylankb</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Events are still attached to `div`, however, the `currentTarget` and `this` context are now both `button`. To rephrase the jQuery documentation above, this is because if a `selector` is provided, the event occurs not on the element the event listener was added to, but on the element(s) matching the `selector` within the parent. With our additional `selector` of `.button`, elements matching the selector are now the ones that call event listeners, and NOT the parent with the attached event.

NO LONGER LOGGING PARENT STUFF IN CODEPEN EXMPLE. IS THAT CORRECT?
