### On Writing: Documentation for the Mind

Literally the instant I graduated college I flew out to Europe where I proceeded to try and walk the entire length of the Alps on foot. I did not succeed (called it quits at the halfway mark), but I did manage to work on several farms, fall in love with cheese, and try my hand at mountaineering along the way. The only regret I have was I didn't save a damn word I wrote during the trip. I have lots of pictures, but they don't capture the feelings and thoughts I had during that time of my life.

I'm now setting out to learn web development at the ripe age of 27. Although I will be carrying out this undertaking almost exclusively sitting down, it's a journey into the unknown all the same. A good journey deserves to be documented, and that's what I'm setting out to do with this blog. No promises on any good writing, though ;)
