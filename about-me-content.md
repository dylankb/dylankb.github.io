My name is Dylan Barnard and I do software engineering work. I primarily focus on building scalable back end systems but have worked on web application front ends as well. I like building thoughtful solutions for technical problems with the people, for the people.

Before my life in tech, I tried my hand at a range of jobs that ranged from fishing for salmon off the Bering Sea to managing the launch of a research platform at a Beijing-based startup. Feel free to ask me about any of the above!

### Recent work

I co-created an experimental, decentralized cloud file storage system called Layr. If you're interested in privacy issues with the cloud, ensuring redundant data across a system, or data structures to power P2P networks, then you should read about our journey of solving tricky problems.
