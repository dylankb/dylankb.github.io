Here are some of the personal projects I've worked on in the past.

### Layr

What if you don't trust the companies who host your files? To explore an alternative to services like Amazon S3 or Dropbox, I co-created an experimental, decentralized
cloud file storage system with private and secure file storage across a peer-to-peer network.

<p>Buzzwords that apply to this project include: Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT), P2P networks, cryptocurrency transactions, smart contracts, and proofs of retrievability.</p>
