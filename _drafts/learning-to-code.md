title: Learning to code
---

My [first blog post]({{ site.url }}{% link _posts/2016-2-13-what-a-blog.md %}) announced to the world (or at least my mom) that I was starting my learning to code journey. Since that first post I followed the generally confusing path one needs take on the way to a career switch in software engineering. I've had a position as a software engineering for a while now, and it's safe to say it's a job and career that I enjoy (hooray!).

That was the first and last personal post I had on here - everything else on here has been purely technical content. One reason for not including more personal anecdotes is that I'm not a super open person on the internet - posting on social media platforms makes my palms sweat. However, looking back I can't help but look back and think that our learning to code stories might be more some of the more helpful information we can share for potential new comers. IMO part of why these stories are so useful to share is because they can vary widely and every learner's background will be a bit different. So this isn't advice per say, but rather a story; here it is.

### The code itch

Back about five years ago I was winding down my time at a start up and had a chance to reflect on my time there. I'd worked in a bunch of roles at the company - sales, translation, project and product roles, etc. - and I realized I most . The times I most enjoyed at work were when I worked with engineers to write bits of HTML and hacky Python to try and bootstrap a platform we were trying to bootstrap. Getting to experience the act of creation was new for me as a non-build/artist but felt awesome! I wanted to know more.
