## About

This is Dylan Barnard's personal website and a blog about learning web development. You can find the site at [dylankb.github.io](http://dylankb.github.io/).

## Setup

If you want to load the blog locally, run the following commands in your terminal:

1. `gem install jekyll, jekyll-paginate, jekyll-gist`
2. `git clone https://github.com/dylankb/dylankb.github.io`
3. `jekyll serve`
4. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser.

If you want to make a Jekyll blog like this one, or you are missing development tools such as Ruby, you can read my guide [here](http://dylankb.github.io/archive/a-beginners-guide-to-jekyll).
